## Proposal ##
For my project, I wanted continue the theme of my portfolio thus far. To bring this idea into a webspace, I would like to follow a similar model to my visual 
project. My orginal idea for doing this was by using a gravity simulator to make words correlating with the icons I used in my visual product to fall, creating a jumbled chaotic pile of words. I would make the word "Mundane" remain suspended in the middle of the page, so the reader is inclined to click that one specifically. As I suspected, I ended up needing to scrap this idea because it was far too advanced given I have never touched code before. I than transitioned towards where my project ended up going, with words randomly scattered around the page and one central "mundane" button. I origninally tried doing this by using individual href elements that I wanted to place around the screen.
