## Proposal ##
For my project, I would like to continue the theme of my portfolio thus far. To bring this idea into a webspace, I would like to follow a similar model to my visual 
project. My idea for doing this is by using a gravity simulator to make words correlating with the icons I used in my visual product to fall, creating a jumbled chaotic 
pile of words. I would make the word "Mundane" remain suspended in the middle of the page, so the reader is inclined to click that one specifically. When the viewer 
clicks on this word, it will ask a question similar to "Is your life too boring?" I will then go into the statistics of how many people feel their lives are too boring 
using graphics to illustrate this idea. I will then include a paragraph on why we should appreciate this mundane lifestyle. If the viewer clicks on one of the words in 
the chaotic pile, it will take them to a respective statistic that explains how many people struggle with that problem. Hopefully it will look something like this:

If I am unable to get a physics sim working, I will do something similar to my visual project and have the words surrounding the word "Mundane," which would still serve the same effect, although it won't be as interesting.
