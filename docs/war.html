    <p> According to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), there were 35 ongoing armed conflicts in 2020, resulting in the deaths of approximately 91,000 people worldwide. The majority of these deaths occurred in just four countries: Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and Mexico. The impact of war extends beyond just the loss of life, with countless others suffering from displacement, physical and mental trauma, and economic devastation. Additionally, conflicts often exacerbate poverty and inequality, hindering development and progress in affected regions.
