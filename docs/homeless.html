    <p> According to the 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, on a single night in January 2020, an estimated 580,466 people in the United States experienced homelessness, including individuals living in shelters and those who were unsheltered. This represents an overall increase of 2.2% since 2019. Of those experiencing homelessness, 67% were individuals and 33% were people in families with children. Additionally, 24% of people experiencing homelessness were identified as chronically homeless, meaning they have experienced homelessness for a year or longer, or at least four times in the past three years.
