    <p> According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, miscarriage is a common experience, with an estimated 10-20% of all pregnancies ending in miscarriage. The psychological effects of miscarriage can be significant, with studies suggesting that women who experience miscarriage may be at increased risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health problems.
