    <p> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 71% of all deaths worldwide, with cardiovascular diseases being the leading cause of death (17.9 million deaths annually), followed by cancers (9.6 million), respiratory diseases (3.0 million), and diabetes (1.6 million). NCDs are often preventable and are associated with lifestyle factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol.
