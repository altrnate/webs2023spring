    <p> According to a meta-analysis of 92 studies on the psychological effects of divorce, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family in 2019, individuals who have experienced divorce have, on average, higher levels of mental health problems than those who have not experienced divorce. Specifically, they found that individuals who have experienced divorce have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and distress, and lower levels of life satisfaction and overall well-being.
