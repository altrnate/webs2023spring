    <p> According to a report by Oxfam, the world's billionaires' combined wealth reached a record high of $10.2 trillion in 2020, while the wealth of the poorest half of the world's population declined by 11%. The report highlights how inequality is fueled by greed, as the wealthiest individuals and corporations prioritize profit over the well-being of people and the planet.
