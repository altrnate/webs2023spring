    <p> According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2020, 75% of adults in the United States say that it is a major threat to their country if other countries develop nuclear weapons. The survey also found that 62% of Americans believe that the use of nuclear weapons is more likely now than it was during the Cold War.
