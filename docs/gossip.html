    <p> A study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that gossip can have negative effects on both the gossiper and the person being gossiped about. Participants who engaged in gossip experienced higher levels of anxiety, guilt, and shame compared to those who did not gossip, while participants who were the subject of gossip experienced lower levels of self-esteem and felt less belonging within their social group. The study suggests that engaging in gossip can have harmful consequences for individuals and their social relationships.
