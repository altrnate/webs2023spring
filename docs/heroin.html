    <p> According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2020, an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States had a heroin use disorder. Additionally, heroin overdose deaths have increased in recent years, with over 14,000 deaths attributed to heroin in 2019 alone. The rise in heroin overdose deaths has been driven in part by the increased availability and use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, which are often mixed with or sold as heroin.
